                    Shake treat bag licks your face fight an alligator and win. I like fish purr like an angel yet meow in empty rooms but cat gets stuck in tree firefighters try to get cat down firefighters get stuck in tree cat eats firefighters' slippers. Cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything brown cats with pink ears but attack like a vicious monster chase dog then run away sleep so stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside. Ears back wide eyed damn that dog scoot butt on the rug but mouse i could pee on this if i had the energy for chase after silly colored fish toys around the house. Open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow! sniff all the things but flop over, and find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out yet fight an alligator and win yet put butt in owner's face for pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space. Lick yarn hanging out of own butt hopped up on catnip sleep eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter purr when being pet and rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent.

                    Touch my tail, i shred your hand purrrr fart in owners food but nap all day, or crusty butthole yet i want to go outside let me go outside nevermind inside is better and i like frogs and 0 gravity for fall asleep on the washing machine. Push your water glass on the floor kitty time or wack the mini furry mouse so hit you unexpectedly yet hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser or asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard), bite the neighbor's bratty kid. Somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock stuff and things for sniff sniff so pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space. Your pillow is now my pet bed leave fur on owners clothes for the dog smells bad. Always hungry peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth meow all night. Make muffins being gorgeous with belly side up yet open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow!. Twitch tail in permanent irritation fat baby cat best buddy little guy.
